# Expo CLI Build Failure: Unclear Native Module Error

This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-diagnose error in Expo CLI builds related to native module incompatibilities.  The error message from the CLI is often unhelpful, making debugging challenging.

## Problem

When building an Expo app (especially after updating dependencies or switching between development and production builds), you might encounter a cryptic error related to native modules. The error message doesn't clearly indicate the source of the problem.

## Solution

The key is to systematically investigate potential conflicts between your project's dependencies and Expo's environment.

1. **Check Package Versions:**  Ensure all your packages, especially those with native module dependencies, are compatible with your Expo SDK version. Consult the package documentation and the Expo compatibility matrix.
2. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Sometimes, cached build artifacts can cause issues. Try cleaning your project's build cache (`expo prebuild --clean`) before rebuilding.
3. **Isolate the Problem:** Create a minimal reproducible example to narrow down the offending package.  Try removing packages one by one until you identify the source of the conflict.
4. **Expo Go Version:** Verify that you're using a compatible version of Expo Go.  An outdated Expo Go app can lead to unexpected issues with more recent SDK versions and native modules.
5. **EAS Build:** If you're using EAS Build, review your build configuration thoroughly, paying close attention to any custom native modules or build settings.
6. **Expo Docs:** Refer to the official Expo documentation for troubleshooting guidance on building with native modules. 

This repository provides sample code to illustrate the problem and its solution.
