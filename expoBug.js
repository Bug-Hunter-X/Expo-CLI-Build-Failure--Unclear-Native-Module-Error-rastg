This error typically arises when there's a mismatch between the native modules required by your Expo app and the environment where it's running.  This often happens after updating dependencies, switching between development and production environments (like using EAS Build), or when using a library that's not fully compatible with Expo's managed workflow.

Example Scenario:

Imagine you're using a library that relies on a native iOS or Android module which isn't properly configured for Expo's build system.  The Expo CLI might not detect or handle this dependency correctly, leading to this cryptic error message during build or runtime. 

Another scenario might involve a mismatch between the version of Expo Go and the SDK version of your project, leading to incompatibilities with some native modules.
