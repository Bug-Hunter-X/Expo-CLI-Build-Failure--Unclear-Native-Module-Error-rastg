The solution depends on the root cause.  However, the most common approach involves these steps:

1. **Update Expo CLI and SDK:** Make sure you have the latest versions of the Expo CLI and SDK.  Run `expo upgrade` and check your `package.json` for the correct versions.
2. **Review Package Compatibility:**  Carefully examine the `package.json` file. Verify that all dependencies, especially those with native components, are compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Check the documentation of any questionable packages.
3. **Clean the Project:** Sometimes, cleaning the build cache resolves unexpected errors.
   ```bash
expo prebuild --clean
expo start
```
4. **Rebuild the Project:** After cleaning, attempt a fresh build to see if that resolves the issue.
5. **Minimal Reproducible Example:**  If you still face problems, create a minimal project that only includes the problematic package to isolate the issue.
6. **Check Expo Go compatibility:** Ensure your Expo Go version is updated.  An older version of Expo Go might not support some features of your newer SDK version.
7. **Consider EAS Build:**  Explore EAS Build (Expo's cloud-based build service) for a more consistent and reliable build process, especially for complex projects. It often handles native module issues more gracefully.
